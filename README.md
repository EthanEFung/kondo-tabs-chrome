# Kondo Tabs
Tidy Tab Manager Chrome Extension

# What is this for?
Kondo tabs is a personal project to help minimize and manage the number of tabs open.
This is for users have too many tabs open, and want to apply KonMari to
digital spaces.

# Report bugs!
Feel free to add reports in the `Issues` tab on this github repository. Hoping to keep
the application simple.
